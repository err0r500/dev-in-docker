# Dev in Docker

Run spacemacs-based dev environments in Docker so you don't have to install anything on your system in order to run and develop in a specific language.


## Dependencies
Nothing mandatory (except Docker)

- I use [x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker) as startup script in order to remove the boilerplate while having security best pratices.

- Emacs is installed by default on images. I use spacemacs but it's just a personnal choice.


## Currently available languages list
- golang
- haskell
- node
- elm
